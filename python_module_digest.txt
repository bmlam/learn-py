pathlib has a few more method than os.path. Like glob, with_name, replace, replace_ext?

The following code echos content of all text files provided as cmdln arguments:
	import fileinput
	for line in fileinput.input():
	    print(line)

tempfile.mktemp is depricated!, use tempfile.mkstemp. This also return the opened file handle.

linecache allows us to print the source code of imported modules.
